Nen Echoes is a game developed in Roblox Studio using Luau. Navigate to the folder of "ServerScripts" to access scripts run on the server-side and navigate to the folder named "Local Scripts"
to access scripts run on the client. You may be wondering what the difference is. Server scripts run commands that affect the entire server, such as a global boss being spawned. Local scripts only run commands that affect the player
from whom the script was fired on, for example a Gui animation. You wouldn't want to make a Gui animation play for everyone because that would be messy, and you wouldn't want to spawn a global boss on a local script because
only that player would see it!
