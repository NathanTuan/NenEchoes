CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE; STILL MIGRATING SCRIPTS


Nen Echoes is a game developed in Roblox Studio using Luau. 

Navigate to the folder of "ServerScripts" to access scripts run on the server-side and navigate to the folder named "Local Scripts"
to access scripts run on the client. 

You may be wondering what the difference is. Server scripts run commands that affect the entire server, such as a global boss being spawned. Local scripts only run commands that affect the player from whom the script was fired on, for example a Gui animation. You wouldn't want to make a Gui animation play for everyone because that would be messy, and you wouldn't want to spawn a global boss on a local script because only that player would see it!

Navigate to the folder of "ReplicatedStorage" to access module scripts that are stored there. "Replicated storage" consists of items that should be replicated to the client when the player joins the game.
